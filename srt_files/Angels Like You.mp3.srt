1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,800
The flowers in hand waiting for me Every word and poetry won't call me by name

2
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:29,359
Only baby, the more that you give The less that I need, everyone says I look happy

3
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,600
When it feels right

4
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:41,439
I know that you're wrong for me Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave

5
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:49,039
I brought you down to your knees Cause they say I'm misery, love's gone funny

6
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:56,159
It's not your fault I ruined everything And it's not your fault I can't be what you need

7
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:02,799
Baby, angels like you can't fly down there with me

8
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm everything they said I would be

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,599
La la la, I'm everything they said I would be

10
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:21,599
I'll put you down slow, love you goodbye Before you let go, just one more time

11
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:29,120
Took off your clothes, pretend that it's fine A little more hurt won't kill you tonight

12
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:38,400
My word says you don't look happy Close your eyes

13
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:46,320
I know that you're wrong for me Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave

14
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:53,920
I brought you down to your knees Cause they say I'm misery, love's gone funny

15
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:01,120
It's not your fault I ruined everything And it's not your fault I can't be what you need

16
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:07,519
Baby, angels like you can't fly down there with me

17
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:11,120
I'm everything they said I would be

18
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:33,119
La la la, I'm everything they said I would be

19
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:41,119
I know that you're wrong for me Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave

20
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:49,119
I brought you down to your knees Cause they say I'm misery, love's gone funny

21
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:56,319
It's not your fault I ruined everything And it's not your fault I can't be what you need

22
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:02,319
Baby, angels like you can't fly down there with me

23
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:12,319
Oh, angels like you can't fly down there with me
