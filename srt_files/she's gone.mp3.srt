1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
Hey, you know, you have to let me go.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:08,960
I know this isn't what you want to hear, but I know you can feel that it's the right thing to do.

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:15,599
Not for me, but for you. I can't give you what you need, what you want, or what you deserve, so

4
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,359
you just have to let me go. You can't keep expecting me to change. You can't keep twisting up the

5
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,800
words I say to fit your expectations of what could be, who will never be what you want us to be.

6
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:33,439
And for that, I really am sorry. You have no idea how much it hurts me that I hurt you,

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,520
because I just can't make myself love you, not in the way that you want, and you shouldn't want that.

8
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,200
Your perfect person will love you just as much as you love them, and you'll never have to question it.

9
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:53,200
You'll finally understand why I'm not the one for you, why I'm so wrong for you,

10
00:00:53,200 --> 00:01:02,000
but you won't see that until you move past me. Please, move past me. Move on with your life without me.

11
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:12,000
You have to let me go, and I hope you know, I know that you'll finally meet the person whom you never want to see.

12
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:33,200
So what you fucking assume? Too cold when you live? Too hot when you live?

13
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,879
If it rained too fucking much, now I'm kind of some real fucking talk.

14
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,280
Maybe you're the only black person applying for a fucking job. Maybe you're the only female.

15
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,320
Maybe you're the only fucking gay person. Job, whatever the fuck it may be. Maybe that's

16
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:54,319
you in your fucking head. Maybe that's your excuse for not being better. Life's a real big fucking picture.

17
00:01:55,039 --> 00:02:01,839
When I was young, all those things got my head black, fucking not smart enough, single mom,

18
00:02:01,839 --> 00:02:07,839
all that bullshit, old space in my head. If you're allowing people and things and situations

19
00:02:07,839 --> 00:02:14,400
to a space in your fucking head, you're losing. Last thing, last one big fucking head game,

20
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:21,680
you play with yourself. If you lose, it's because you allow life to get in your fucking head. Stay hard.
